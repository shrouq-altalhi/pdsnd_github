### Project Title
bicycle-sharing systems

### Description
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price.This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
